`yarn start` - Starts webpack-dev-server on port 3000. It's worth noting that the image-webpack-loader can slow the updates down so maybe comment this out when working locally. If you make any changes to files in the "build" directory you will need to rerun this command.

`yarn build` - Generates the build files into the `dist` directory. You should be able to copy and paste this to the server.
